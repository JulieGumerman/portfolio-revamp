            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I like exploring new things to do outside. I also like coding and talking to people about tech.</p> 
            <p>Tech is both a solo activity and a group endeavor. I love that moment when your meetings are all done for the day and all you have left to do is code by yourself in the quiet. However, I also love pair programming. Nothing is quite like spinning your wheels for two hours with a coworker-friend only to have your tests all turn green at the last possible minute before you have to jet for your next meeting. Virtual high fives and cheers of elation ensue, and everyone is happy.</p>
